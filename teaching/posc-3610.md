The onset, expansion and consequences of inter-state conflict lie at the heart of international relations scholarship.  This class will explore these topics, highlighting what we know and what we do not know.  We will first start by clarifying how "inter-state conflict" is defined and measured, also providing basic statistics about its occurrence through time. Then, we will examine one of the long industry standards in international relations, looking at properties of the international system that are thought to explain inter-state conflict.  Afterwards, we discuss theories and research programs that eschew structural properties in favor of either the properties of states or the issues that make them susceptible to fight each other.  We will conclude with a discussion, however introductory, of some more advanced topics for students to consider as they pursue their studies in political science.
